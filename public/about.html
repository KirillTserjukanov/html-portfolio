<h2>Everlong</h2>
<p>Hello</p>
<p>I've waited here for you</p>
<p>Everlong</p>

<p>Tonight, I throw myself into</p>
<p>And out of the red</p>
<p>Out of her head, she sang</p>

<p>Come down and waste away with me</p>
<p>Down with me</p>
<p>Slow, how you wanted it to be</p>
<p>I'm over my head</p>
<p>Out of her head, she sang</p>

<p>And I wonder</p>
<p>When I sing along with you</p>

<p>If everything could ever be this real forever</p>
<p>If anything could ever be this good again</p>
<p>The only thing I'll ever ask of you</p>
<p>You've got to promise not to stop when I say when</p>
<p>She sang</p>

<p>Breathe out</p>
<p>So I can breathe you in</p>
<p>Hold you in</p>
<p>And now</p>
<p>I know you've always been</p>
<p>Out of your head</p>
<p>Out of my head, I sang</p>

<p>And I wonder
<p>When I sing along with you</p>

<p>If everything could ever feel this real forever</p>
<p>If anything could ever be this good again <p>
<p>The only thing I'll ever ask of you</p>
<p>You've got to promise not to stop when I say when</p>
<p>She sang</p>

<p>And I wonder</p>

<p>If everything could ever feel this real forever</p>
<p>If anything could ever be this good again</p>
<p>The only thing I'll ever ask of you</p>
<p>You've got to promise not to stop when I say when</p>
